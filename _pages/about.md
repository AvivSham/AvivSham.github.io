I hold a PhD in Machine Learning from Bar Ilan University, where I worked under the joint supervision of <a href="https://chechiklab.biu.ac.il/~gal/"> Prof. Gal Chechik</a>, head of the <a href="http://chechiklab.biu.ac.il/"> Computational Neurobiology Lab</a> at the <a href="http://www.gondabrain.biu.ac.il/">Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center</a>, and <a href="http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/fetayae/"> Prof. Ethan Fetaya</a> from the Faculty of Engineering. My research focused on multi-task learning and learning in weight-space methods.

I hold a BSc in Biomedical Engineering (summa cum laude).

I have several years of industry experience, working as a Data Scientist and Researcher in various domains. Currently, I work as Data Science Tech Lead at aiOla, where I lead the technical design and architecture of data science projects, driving research through publications in top-tier speech conferences.
